## Human Services Link

Human Services Link is a forward engineering of the Link-SF (https://link-sf.com/) project to make it run as a simple human services website, admin, and API that runs 100% on Github.  It is a smaller, simpler, human services implementation that is self-contained and can be forked by anyone looking to deploy a human services support site in their local area. This project runs 100% on Github, using the Github repository as the hosting, and Github Pages (https://pages.github.com/) as the front-end website. The project uses Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/) as the content management system which employes the data capabilities of the open source CMS, to behave as any database driven website application would. The project can be download and forked, and run in your own Github account--if you have any questions you can submit your questions via a Github issue on the master Github project (ttps://adopta-agency.github.io/human-services-link/).
