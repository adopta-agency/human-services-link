  image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-key-circle.png
  header: The Open Referral API is a publicly available API. There is no authentication required to just GET, or read information. It is publicly available, all you need to know is the URL, path, and the relevant parameters.
  footer: During the next phase of the project we will introduce paths for adding, updating, and deleting data for partners. Authentication will be required for the Open Referral API to help maintain the integrity of the data in the system, balancing public access to the data, while remaining a high level of quality regarding who can update and delete information.
