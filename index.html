		<p>Everytime I work on the Open Referral project I use this page as my start page. I will be updating it regularly as I have more information about the work that is going on. I will syndicate blog posts, and link up other Github repositories and projects as they become available--so return often, and feel free to bookmark this page.</p>
		<p>Open Referral is Greg's passion, something that is contagious, and help contribute to it becoming my passion. I can't think of a more important API to be working on in today's political climate. We need to be investing in our communities at the local level, and a human services API can help bring folks together, delivering a common approach to helping people find the human services they need to get through the day.</p>
		<p>Thanks for tuning in, and let me know how I can help get you plugged into what we are doing.</p>
